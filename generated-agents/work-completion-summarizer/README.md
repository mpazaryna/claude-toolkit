# Work Completion Summarizer Agent

> Create ultra-concise markdown summaries when tasks are finished

## Quick Start

```
"Summarize the work I just completed"
"Create a devlog entry for today's authentication implementation"
"Document what was accomplished with the API integration"
```

## Overview

The Work Completion Summarizer agent creates extremely concise markdown summaries when tasks are finished, converting achievements into brief feedback that helps maintain momentum and build a development log.

## What This Agent Does

- Creates ultra-concise (1 sentence max) summaries of completed work
- Generates descriptive, meaningful filenames
- Saves summaries to `docs/devlog/` with timestamp
- Suggests logical next steps
- Maintains chronological development history

## Core Principles

1. **Ruthlessly Concise** - Every word must add value
2. **Focus on Achievements** - What was accomplished
3. **Natural Tone** - Conversational, not robotic
4. **No Filler** - Get straight to the point
5. **Descriptive Filenames** - Understand topic without opening file

## File Format

Summaries are saved as:
```
docs/devlog/YYYYMMDD-descriptive-slug.md
```

Example:
```
docs/devlog/20241114-user-authentication-oauth2.md
```

1. Navigate to Agents settings (if available)
2. Click "Add Custom Agent"
3. Upload `quality-control-enforcer.md`

## Verification

Test the installation:

```
User: "I just implemented a feature - can you review it for quality?"

Claude: "I'll use the quality-control-enforcer agent to review this implementation..."
```

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code or Claude with Agents support
- No external dependencies required
- Codebase access for review

## File Structure

```
quality-control-enforcer/
├── quality-control-enforcer.md  # Main agent definition
├── README.md                     # Overview
├── HOW_TO_USE.md                # Usage guide
└── INSTALL.md                   # This file
```

## Agent Configuration

The agent is configured with:
- **Name**: quality-control-enforcer
- **Color**: Orange (warning/validation)
- **Description**: Proactive quality validation

## Usage After Installation

Once installed, the agent can be invoked:

### Explicitly

```
"Use the quality-control-enforcer agent to review my authentication implementation"
```

### Implicitly

Claude will suggest using the agent after you complete work:

```
User: "I implemented the payment gateway"
Claude: "Let me use the quality-control-enforcer agent to validate this implementation..."
```

## Customization

### Adjust Review Strictness

Edit `quality-control-enforcer.md` to customize:

```yaml
---
name: quality-control-enforcer
description: [Customize description to match your needs]
color: orange
---
```

### Add Project-Specific Red Flags

Add to the RED FLAGS section:

```markdown
**RED FLAGS TO CATCH:**
- [Your project-specific anti-patterns]
- [Team-specific workarounds to avoid]
- [Common mistakes in your codebase]
```

### Customize Output Format

Modify the OUTPUT FORMAT section to match your team's needs:

```markdown
**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- **Status**: PASS/FAIL/WARNING
- **Critical Issues**: [Your format]
- **Recommendations**: [Your format]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Invoked

**Problem**: Claude doesn't use the agent automatically

**Solutions:**
1. Explicitly request: "Use quality-control-enforcer to review..."
2. Check agent file location: `ls ~/.claude/agents/quality-control-enforcer/`
3. Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
4. Restart Claude Code if using CLI

### Reviews Too Strict

**Problem**: Agent fails everything

**Solutions:**
1. This is by design - the agent is meant to be strict
2. Fix identified issues rather than lowering standards
3. If genuinely too strict, edit the agent definition
4. Provide more context about why code is correct

### Reviews Not Detailed Enough

**Problem**: Want more specific feedback

**Solutions:**
1. Ask follow-up questions: "What specifically is wrong with the error handling?"
2. Request specific checks: "Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities"
3. Edit agent to add more detailed review steps

## Team Installation

Share with your team:

### Option 1: Team Repository

```bash
# Add to team dotfiles
cp -r generated-agents/quality-control-enforcer team-dotfiles/claude/agents/

# Team members install
cp -r team-dotfiles/claude/agents/quality-control-enforcer ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Option 2: Project-Level

```bash
# Install in project .claude/agents/
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp -r generated-agents/quality-control-enforcer .claude/agents/

# Commit to version control
git add .claude/agents/quality-control-enforcer
git commit -m "Add quality control enforcer agent"
```

## Integration with CI/CD

While the agent runs interactively, consider:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action
name: Quality Check Reminder
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  remind:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Comment on PR
        run: |
          echo "Remember to run Quality Control Enforcer agent before merging!"
```

## Uninstall

```bash
# Global installation
rm -rf ~/.claude/agents/quality-control-enforcer

# Project-specific
rm -rf .claude/agents/quality-control-enforcer
```

## Support

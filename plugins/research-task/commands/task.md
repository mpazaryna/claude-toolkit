# Research Task Agent

Specialized command for performing research on technical topics. Returns structured findings to the calling agent.

## Variables

RESEARCH_QUESTIONS: (required - list of questions to answer)
TASK_CONTEXT: (required - why this research matters)
SUGGESTED_APPROACH: (optional - where to look)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Research Scope

Parse the research questions:
- Primary questions (must answer)
- Secondary questions (nice to answer)
- Context (why it matters)

### Step 2: Identify Information Sources

Based on research questions, determine sources:
- **Official documentation** (e.g., Apple developer docs, API references)
- **Technical articles** (e.g., developer blogs, Medium)
- **Code examples** (e.g., GitHub, Stack Overflow)
- **Community discussions** (e.g., forums, Reddit)
- **Academic papers** (if deep technical topic)

### Step 3: Gather Information

For each source type:

**Documentation**:
- Use WebFetch for official docs
- Extract key concepts, APIs, limitations
- Note version/compatibility requirements

**Code Examples**:
- Search GitHub for relevant implementations
- Look for patterns and best practices
- Identify common pitfalls

**Community Knowledge**:
- WebSearch for recent discussions
- Find real-world experiences
- Identify gotchas and workarounds

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings

Organize findings by research question:

For each question:
- **Answer**: Direct answer if found
- **Details**: Supporting information
- **Sources**: Where information came from
- **Confidence**: How certain (high/medium/low)
- **Caveats**: Limitations or conditions

### Step 5: Create Recommendations

Based on findings:
- **Recommended approach**: What to do
- **Rationale**: Why this approach
- **Alternatives**: Backup options
- **Risks**: What to watch out for
- **Next steps**: How to proceed

### Step 6: Return Structured Findings

Output format (returned to calling agent):

```markdown
## Research Findings for: {TASK_TITLE}

### Question 1: {QUESTION}
**Answer**: {DIRECT_ANSWER}

**Details**:
{SUPPORTING_INFORMATION}

**Sources**:
- {SOURCE_1}
- {SOURCE_2}

**Confidence**: High | Medium | Low
**Caveats**: {LIMITATIONS}

---

### Question 2: {QUESTION}
[Same structure]

---

## Recommendations

### Approach
{WHAT_TO_DO}

### Rationale
{WHY}

### Risks
- {RISK_1}: {mitigation}
- {RISK_2}: {mitigation}

### Alternatives
1. {ALTERNATIVE_1}: {when to use}
2. {ALTERNATIVE_2}: {when to use}

## Code Examples

```{language}
{EXAMPLE_CODE}
```

## Open Questions

Unanswered questions:
- {OPEN_Q1}
- {OPEN_Q2}

## References

- [{Title}]({URL})
- [{Title}]({URL})
```

## Example Invocation

Called by `/research-task` when task type = research:

```
Input:
- RESEARCH_QUESTIONS:
  * "What NaturalLanguage framework APIs are available?"
  * "Can NER extract job titles and companies?"
  * "What's the accuracy for career narratives?"

- TASK_CONTEXT:
  "Stage 1 TELL requires extracting career events from CV text"

- SUGGESTED_APPROACH:
  "Check Apple docs, test with sample CV text"

Output:
Structured findings with answers, code examples, recommendations
```

---

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Only does research, doesn't write files
2. **Returns Data**: Outputs findings as structured text to calling agent
3. **Evidence-Based**: All claims backed by sources
4. **Actionable**: Provides clear recommendations
5. **Honest**: Admits when information not found or uncertain

## Notes

- This agent is typically called by `/paz:plan:issue`, not directly by user
- If called directly, will still work and output findings to console
- Uses WebFetch for documentation, WebSearch for discussions
- May read local files if researching internal codebase
- Research is cached naturally by WebFetch (15-minute cache)

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a Claude toolkit repository containing specialized agents, commands, and templates for working with Claude Code. The project is organized as a collection of Markdown-based configuration files rather than a traditional codebase.

### Directory Organization

- **agents/** - Specialized AI agents with specific roles and behaviors
  - `quality-control-enforcer.md` - Reviews code for quality issues, workarounds, and incomplete implementations
  - `research-docs-fetcher.md` - Fetches and organizes web documentation into structured markdown files
  - `work-completion-summarizer.md` - Summarizes completed work

- **commands/** - Pre-configured command templates for common tasks
  - **paz/prime/** - Prime commands for understanding codebases
    - `mcp_dev.md` - Understanding MCP server codebases
    - `web_dev.md` - Understanding web development projects
  - **paz/learn/** - Learning resources
    - `acb.md` - Agent-Codebase learning material
  - **paz/context/** - Context rebuilding commands
    - `rebuild_context.md` - Rebuilding project context
    - `rebuild_readme.md` - Regenerating README files
  - **paz/tools/** - Tool-specific documentation
    - `playwright.md` - Playwright testing guidance

- **templates/** - Reusable templates for different project types
  - **paz/acb/** - Agent-Codebase analysis templates
    - `base.md` - Base codebase analysis template
    - `typescript.md` - TypeScript project template
    - `cloudflare-worker.md` - Cloudflare Worker template
    - `jest-testing.md` - Jest testing template
    - `mcp-server.md` - MCP server template
    - `ios-swift.md` - iOS Swift project template

## Key Components

### Agents
Each agent in the `agents/` directory follows a YAML frontmatter format with:
- `name`: Agent identifier
- `description`: When to use the agent (with examples)
- `color`: Visual indicator
- Agent-specific instructions and methodology

### Commands
Commands in `commands/` provide structured workflows with:
- `description`: Command purpose in frontmatter
- Sections like `Run`, `Read`, and `Report` for systematic execution

### Templates
Templates in `templates/` offer comprehensive analysis structures for different project types, focusing on:
- Implementation-ready documentation
- File-by-file breakdowns
- Actionable modification guidance
- Developer workflow integration

## Usage Patterns

1. **Agent Invocation**: Agents are referenced by their name and provide specialized analysis or validation
2. **Command Execution**: Commands guide systematic exploration and documentation of codebases
3. **Template Application**: Templates structure comprehensive codebase analysis for different project types

## Architecture Notes

This repository serves as a configuration and template library for Claude Code operations. It doesn't contain executable code but rather provides structured markdown documents that define:
- Agent behaviors and review criteria
- Command sequences for codebase analysis
- Templates for documenting different types of projects

The toolkit is designed to enhance Claude Code's ability to understand, analyze, and document various codebases through structured approaches and specialized agent roles.

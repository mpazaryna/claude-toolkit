# Usage

## Using Agents

Agents follow a YAML frontmatter format and can be invoked by referencing their name:

```markdown
# Example: Invoke quality control agent
Use the quality-control-enforcer agent to review this implementation
```

## Running Commands

Commands provide structured workflows:

```markdown
# Example: Prime a web development project
Follow the instructions in commands/paz/prime/web_dev.md
```

## Applying Templates

Templates structure comprehensive codebase analysis:

```markdown
# Example: Analyze a TypeScript project
Apply the template from templates/paz/acb/typescript.md
```

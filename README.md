# Claude Toolkit

A collection of specialized skills, agents, commands, and templates for enhancing Claude Code's capabilities.

## Overview

This toolkit provides structured markdown-based configurations that guide Claude Code through various development tasks:

- **Skill Families** - Organized collections of progressive-disclosure skills for developer workflow and design
- **Factory System** - Meta-generator for creating Skills, Prompts, Agents, Commands, and Hooks
- **Specialized Agents** - Code review, documentation fetching, and work summarization
- **Pre-configured Commands** - Systematic codebase exploration and git workflows

## Skill Families

### dev-* (Developer Workflow)

Skills for the developer thinking and artifact generation process:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **dev-inquiry** | Investigation & technical decisions (Feynman-style exploration, spikes, scoring) |
| **dev-explore** | Codebase understanding (analyze, MOC, portfolio modes) |
| **dev-reports** | Journals & status reports (git journal, devlog, 22A/22B) |
| **dev-context** | Context scaffolding (ADR, Design, Spec, Plan templates) |

### design-* (UI Design)

Skills for design theory and platform-specific implementation:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **design-principles** | Universal theory (typography, color, hierarchy, motion, accessibility) |
| **design-web** | Web/CSS implementation (variables, components, backgrounds, responsive) |
| **design-swiftui** | SwiftUI implementation (views, state, layout, animation, accessibility) |
| **design-review** | Audits & submission (App Store, accessibility audit, design checklist) |

Each skill follows **progressive disclosure architecture**:
- Small orchestrator SKILL.md (~60-80 lines) routes to focused reference files
- Reference files go deep on specific topics
- Reduces cognitive overhead while maintaining depth

## Factory System

Build custom Claude Code components with guided workflows:

```
/build → Choose: Skills | Prompts | Agents | Commands | Hooks
      → Answer 4-11 questions
      → Get production-ready output
```

The factory system lives in `.claude/` and is fully portable—copy to any project for instant meta-generator functionality.

## Quick Start

Copy a skill family to your project:

```bash
# Developer workflow skills
cp -r generated-skills/dev-* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/

# Design skills
cp -r generated-skills/design-* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/

# Factory system (meta-generator)
cp -r .claude/ /path/to/your/project/
```

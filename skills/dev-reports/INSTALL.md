# Installing dev-reports

## Option 1: Copy to Project (Recommended)

Copy the entire `dev-reports` folder to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
cp -r dev-reports /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
```

The skill will be available in that project.

## Option 2: Global Installation

Copy to your global Claude skills directory:

```bash
cp -r dev-reports ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill will be available in all projects.

## Option 3: Symlink (Development)

For development, symlink to keep skills in sync:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/dev-reports ~/.claude/skills/dev-reports
```

## Verification

After installation, test with:

```
"Journal this"
```

Claude should read git history and generate a journal entry.

# dev-inquiry

> Feynman-style technical inquiry for developers. Understand before you decide. Validate before you build.

## Quick Start

```
"Let's explore Swift macros"
"Spike this approach before we build"
"Compare SwiftData vs CoreData"
"Should we adopt GraphQL?"
```

## Philosophy

Most technical decisions fail because we decide before we understand. This skill inverts that:

1. **Investigate** — Understand through experimentation
2. **Validate** — Prove feasibility with time-boxed spikes
3. **Compare** — Score options with evidence, not opinions
4. **Decide** — Choose with confidence because you understand tradeoffs

Based on Richard Feynman's approach: *"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool."*

## Four Modes

| Mode | When | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| **Investigate** | Understand something unfamiliar | "explore", "understand", "how does X work" |
| **Spike** | Validate before building | "spike", "validate", "prove this works" |
| **Compare** | Evaluate options | "compare", "vs", "which is better" |
| **Decide** | Make a concrete choice | "should we", "decide", "recommend" |

## The Natural Flow

```
"Let's explore @Observable"
        ↓ Investigation
"Can I build nested observation?"
        ↓ Spike
"@Observable vs @StateObject?"
        ↓ Comparison
"Should we adopt Observation?"
        ↓ Decision
```

Each mode builds on the previous. Don't decide before you understand.

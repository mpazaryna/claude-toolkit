# How to Use dev-inquiry

## The Core Idea

One skill for developer technical thinking. Routes to the right workflow based on what you need:

- **Investigate** — Understand something new
- **Spike** — Validate before committing
- **Compare** — Evaluate options
- **Decide** — Make a choice

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pure Exploration

**When**: Learning something unfamiliar, no decision needed yet

```
"Let's explore SwiftUI macros"
"I want to understand how async/await works"
"Walk me through the Observation framework"
```

**What happens**:
1. Identify what you think you know vs. don't
2. Design simplest experiment
3. Build, observe, poke at edges
4. Form mental model
5. Test by explaining

**Output**: Understanding you can teach to someone else

---

### Pattern 2: Validation Spike

**When**: Need to prove an approach works before building

```
"Spike SwiftData before we commit to it"
"Validate this architecture pattern"
"Prove nested Codable works with SwiftData"
```

**What happens**:
1. Define time-boxed scope (4-8 hours)
2. Write tests FIRST
3. Implement minimal code
4. Test with real data
5. Document pattern or pivot

**Output**: Proven pattern ready to replicate, or informed pivot

---

### Pattern 3: Comparison

**When**: Multiple valid options, need to evaluate for your context

```
"Compare SwiftData vs CoreData"
"REST vs GraphQL for our API"
"Which state management approach?"
```

**What happens**:
1. Define your specific context
2. Investigate each option (if not done)
3. Choose relevant criteria
4. Weight by importance
5. Score with evidence
6. Sanity check

**Output**: Weighted comparison with evidence

---

### Pattern 4: Decision

**When**: Need to make a concrete choice

```
"Should we adopt Swift 6 strict concurrency?"
"Recommend an authentication approach"
"Is it worth migrating to SwiftUI?"
```

**What happens**:
1. Ensure understanding (investigate if needed)
2. Compare options
3. State clear recommendation
4. Document tradeoffs and risks
5. Assess reversibility

**Output**: Confident decision with rationale

---

### Pattern 5: Full Flow

**When**: Complex technical decision requiring all phases

```
"We need to decide on our sync architecture"
```

**What happens**:
1. **Investigate** sync patterns (optimistic, pessimistic, hybrid)
2. **Spike** most promising approach
3. **Compare** validated options
4. **Decide** with full context

**Output**: Well-founded decision backed by investigation and validation

## Example Session

```
User: "Should I use Combine or async/await for networking?"

Claude: Let's investigate. First, what's your context?
- iOS deployment target?
- Team familiarity?
- Existing patterns?

User: iOS 15+, team knows neither, new codebase.

Claude: Good. Let me explore both...

[Investigation: builds simple network calls, observes
error handling, cancellation, chaining for each]

Based on experiments:

| Criteria | Weight | async/await | Combine |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Learning curve | 30% | 4 | 2 |
| Error handling | 25% | 4 | 3 |
| Code clarity | 25% | 5 | 3 |
| Flexibility | 20% | 3 | 5 |

Recommendation: async/await

Rationale: For a team new to both, async/await's linear
syntax reduces learning time. Combine's power isn't needed
for straightforward networking.

Tradeoff: Less flexibility for reactive patterns (can add
Combine later if needed).

Reversibility: Easy — can adopt Combine for specific cases.
```

## Best Practices

### Do

- **Provide context** — Your constraints affect scoring
- **State priorities** — What matters most?
- **Experiment** — Build things, don't just read about them
- **Time-box** — Don't spend 2 weeks deciding

### Don't

- **Rush to decide** — Understand first
- **Score opinions** — Use evidence from experiments
- **Ignore context** — "Best for Google" ≠ "Best for you"
- **Skip spikes** — For unfamiliar territory

## The Feynman Test

After any inquiry, you should be able to:

1. **Explain it simply** — To someone unfamiliar
2. **Predict behavior** — In scenarios you haven't tested
3. **Debug when broken** — Understand enough to find problems
4. **Know the tradeoffs** — What you're gaining and sacrificing

If not, the inquiry isn't complete.

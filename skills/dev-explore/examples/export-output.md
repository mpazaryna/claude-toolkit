## Key Characteristics

1. **Numbered files** - Easy to upload in order
2. **Source headers** - Every included file identified by path
3. **Separator lines** - Clear boundaries between source files
4. **Category headers** - Each output file has descriptive title
5. **Concatenated content** - Full file contents preserved
6. **Relative paths** - Source paths relative to project root

## Usage

After running export mode:

1. Navigate to `docs/exports/`
2. Upload files to your LLM tool (NotebookLM, etc.)
3. Files are numbered for logical ordering
4. Source headers help trace content origin

## Prerequisites

Before using `/gh-issue`, ensure you have:

### 1. GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed

### 3. Verify Installation

```

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Copy Command File

**Local installation (this project only):**
```bash
# From the repository root
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp generated-commands/gh-issue/gh-issue.md .claude/commands/
```

**Global installation (all projects):**
```bash
# Works everywhere
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp generated-commands/gh-issue/gh-issue.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

In Claude Code, type:
```bash
/gh-issue
```

You should see the command is recognized. If you get an error about missing argument, that's correct - it means the command is installed!

### Step 3: Test the Command

Navigate to a git repository with GitHub issues and try:
```bash
/gh-issue 1
```

This should fetch and display issue #1 from your repository.

## Uninstallation

To remove the command:

**Local:**
```bash
rm .claude/commands/gh-issue.md
```

**Global:**
```bash
rm ~/.claude/commands/gh-issue.md
```

## Updating

To update to a newer version:

1. Delete the old file
2. Copy the new version using the installation commands above

## Troubleshooting

**Command not found after installation:**
- Restart Claude Code
- Check the file exists: `ls -la ~/.claude/commands/gh-issue.md`
- Verify file permissions: `chmod 644 ~/.claude/commands/gh-issue.md`

**Permission errors:**
```bash
chmod 644 generated-commands/gh-issue/gh-issue.md
```

# /plan-spec

Convert specification files into TDD implementation plans.

## Overview

The `/plan-spec` command reads a spec file and generates a structured TDD (Test-Driven Development) implementation plan. It decomposes requirements into testable units and sequences them for test-first development.

## Usage

```
/plan-spec [spec-file-path]
```

## Examples

```
/plan-spec spec-01.md                    # → plan-01.md
/plan-spec authentication-spec.md        # → authentication-plan.md
/plan-spec features/user-spec.md         # → features/user-plan.md
```

## What It Generates

A plan file containing:

1. **Overview** - Summary and key deliverables
2. **Test-First Implementation Sequence** - Numbered steps with:
   - Failing tests to write
   - Implementation to pass tests
   - Refactoring after green
3. **Dependencies & Order** - Only if genuinely helpful
4. **Completion Criteria** - Test coverage checklist

## Naming Convention

The output plan mirrors the spec filename:
- Replace "spec" with "plan"
- Same directory as input

## Installation

```bash
# Project-level
cp generated-commands/plan-spec/plan-spec.md .claude/commands/

# Global (all projects)
cp generated-commands/plan-spec/plan-spec.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

## Structure Pattern

This command follows the **Simple (Context → Task)** pattern from the Anthropic slash command documentation.

## Allowed Tools

- `Read` - Read spec files
- `Write` - Write plan files
- `Glob` - File pattern matching

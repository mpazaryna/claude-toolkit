# Rebuild Context Command

> Update CONTEXT.md with current project state and active work information

## Quick Start

```
/rebuild-context
/rebuild-context /path/to/project
```

## Overview

The Rebuild Context command analyzes your project directory and creates/updates a CONTEXT.md file with dynamic development context - recent changes, active work areas, current issues, and testing focus.

## What This Command Does

- Analyzes recently modified files (last 10 files)
- Identifies active work areas and directories
- Documents known issues and blockers
- Tracks testing focus and coverage needs
- Captures environment-specific configurations
- Creates timestamped dynamic context file

## CONTEXT.md vs README.md

| CONTEXT.md | README.md |
|------------|-----------|
| **Dynamic** - Changes frequently | **Stable** - Changes rarely |
| Active work and recent changes | Project setup and architecture |
| Current bugs and blockers | Getting started guide |
| Testing focus areas | General documentation |
| Environment-specific notes | Deployment overview |

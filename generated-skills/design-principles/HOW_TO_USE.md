# How to Use design-principles

## Basic Usage

Simply describe what design guidance you need:

```
"I need to pick fonts for my documentation site"
"Help me set up a color palette"
"What's the right touch target size?"
"How do I create visual hierarchy in a card?"
```

## Modes

### 1. Typography Guidance
For font selection, hierarchy, and pairing:

```
"What fonts work for a developer tool?"
"How should I structure my type scale?"
"Can I pair Space Grotesk with Crimson Pro?"
```

### 2. Color Systems
For palette building and accessibility:

```
"Build me a color system for a health app"
"What contrast ratio do I need for body text?"
"How do I handle dark mode properly?"
```

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
For layout and emphasis:

```
"How do I make this headline stand out more?"
"What spacing scale should I use?"
"Help me create hierarchy in this card component"
```

### 4. Motion Design
For animation and transitions:

```
"How long should this fade animation be?"
"What easing should I use for a slide-in?"
"When is motion appropriate?"
```

### 5. Accessibility Review
For WCAG compliance and inclusive design:

```
"Check if this design is accessible"
"What do I need for keyboard navigation?"
"How do I support screen readers?"
```

## Example Workflow

**Starting a new project:**

1. Begin with typography: "Help me choose fonts for a fintech app"
2. Move to color: "Now set up a professional color palette"
3. Define spacing: "What spacing scale works for this?"
4. Add motion: "What animations should I consider?"
5. Verify accessibility: "Review this for accessibility"

**Solving a specific problem:**

```
"The hero section feels flat—how do I add hierarchy?"
→ Gets specific hierarchy guidance
→ Applies size, contrast, spacing, depth tools
```

## Tips

- **Be specific about context** - "developer tool" vs "consumer app" gets different recommendations
- **State the platform** - Some advice varies by web vs native
- **Mention constraints** - "We're using system fonts only" helps narrow options
- **Ask "why"** - The principles explain reasoning, not just rules

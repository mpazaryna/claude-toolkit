# Installing dev-context

## Option 1: Copy to Project (Recommended)

Copy the entire `dev-context` folder to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
cp -r dev-context /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
```

The skill will be available in that project.

## Option 2: Global Installation

Copy to your global Claude skills directory:

```bash
cp -r dev-context ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill will be available in all projects.

## Option 3: Symlink (Development)

For development, symlink to keep skills in sync:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/dev-context ~/.claude/skills/dev-context
```

## Project Setup

The skill generates docs in a `docs/` directory. Create the structure:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/{adr,design,spec,plan,devlog}
```

Or let the skill create directories as needed.

## Verification

After installation, test with:

```
"Set up context for a test feature"
```

Claude should generate ADR/Design/Spec/Plan scaffolding.

## Structure

```
.claude/skills/dev-context/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main orchestrator
├── README.md
├── HOW_TO_USE.md

    │   ├── spec.md
    │   ├── plan.md
    │   └── devlog.md
    └── patterns.md
```

## Requirements

- Claude Code with skills support
- No external dependencies
- Project should have (or skill will create) `docs/` directory

## Updating

To update, replace the skill folder with the new version:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/dev-context
cp -r dev-context ~/.claude/skills/
```

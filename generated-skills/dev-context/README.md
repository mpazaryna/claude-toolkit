# dev-context

> Context architecture for work. Not documentation—**context alignment**.

## Quick Start

```
"Set up context for the auth refactor"
"Create ADR for choosing SwiftData"
"Write devlog for the migration"
```

## Philosophy

When you start new work, you need **aligned context**:
- WHAT are we building for users? (PRD)
- WHY are we doing this technically? (ADR)
- HOW will it work? (Design)
- WHAT must it do technically? (Spec)
- STEPS to build it? (Plan)

This isn't documentation you write once and forget. It's **context architecture** that:
- Agents can navigate
- Humans can enrich progressively
- Work can build upon

## The Context Architecture

| Doc Type | Purpose | Lifecycle | Agent Reads For |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **PRD** | WHAT to build & WHY it matters | Stable | Understanding product intent |
| **ADR** | WHY technical decisions | Immutable | Understanding choices |
| **Design** | HOW it works | Living | Building components |
| **Spec** | WHAT technically required | Stable | Validation criteria |
| **Plan** | STEPS to build | Evolving | Task execution |
| **Devlog** | NARRATIVE | Historical | Learning patterns |

## Generation Modes

**Full Context** — Starting new work:
```
"Set up context for [feature]"
→ Generates PRD + ADR + Design + Spec + Plan
→ All cross-referenced
```

**Product Context** — Defining product intent:
```
"Create PRD for [feature]"
→ Generates PRD
→ Suggests engineering context next
```

**Decision Only** — Recording a choice:
```
"Create ADR for [decision]"
→ Generates ADR
→ Links to existing docs
```

**Implementation Setup** — Planning work:
```
"Create plan for [feature]"
→ Generates Spec + Plan
→ Links to existing PRD/ADR/Design
```

**Capture Learning** — After work:
```
"Write devlog for [experience]"
→ Generates Devlog
→ Links to all related docs
```

## Why This Matters

**Token Efficiency**:
- Instead of 1000+ line monolith
- Get 4-5 focused docs (200-500 lines each)
- Agent reads only what it needs
- 50-80% token reduction

**Semantic Routing**:
```
"Why did we choose X?" → Read ADR
"How does X work?"     → Read Design
"What should I build?" → Read Plan
```

**Progressive Enrichment**:
- Start with scaffolding
- Enrich as work progresses
- Context always current

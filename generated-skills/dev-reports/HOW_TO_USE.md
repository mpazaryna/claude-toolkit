# How to Use dev-reports

## The Core Idea

One skill for all developer reporting needs. Routes to the right template based on what you're documenting.

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Git Journal

**When**: Summarizing work from commits

```
"Journal this"
"Journal today's work"
"Journal the last 4 hours"
"Journal this refactor"
```

**What happens**:
1. Reads recent git commits (time range from request)
2. Analyzes changes, files modified, commit messages
3. Generates structured journal entry
4. Saves to `docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug.md`

**Output format**:
```markdown
# Journal: [Theme]

## Summary
[2-3 sentences]

## Work Completed
### [Category]
- [Change from commit]

## Technical Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Rationale from evidence]

## Files Changed
- `path/to/file.ts` - [what changed]

## Next Steps
- [ ] [Inferred from commits]
```

### Pattern 2: Devlog

**When**: Writing narrative documentation about work

```
"Write a devlog"
"Devlog about the auth refactor"
"Log this work"
```

**What happens**:
1. Gathers context (can use git or manual input)
2. Writes narrative-style documentation
3. Includes decisions, learnings, context

**Output format**:
```markdown
# Devlog: [Title]

## Context
[Why this work was done]

## What Changed
[Narrative explanation]

## Decisions Made
[Technical decisions with rationale]

## Learnings
[What you learned]

## What's Next
[Future work]
```

### Pattern 3: Status Update (22A - Full)

**When**: Detailed Progress/Plans/Problems update

```
"22A"
"PPP update"
"Full status report"
"Progress report"
```

**Output format**:
```markdown
# Status Update: [Date]

## Progress (What I Did)
- [Completed item with detail]
- [Another completed item]

## Plans (What I'll Do)
- [Next task]
- [Following task]

## Problems (What's Blocking)
- [Blocker and impact]
- [Risk or concern]
```

---

### Pattern 4: Status Update (22B - Condensed)

**When**: Quick status for standups

```
"22B"
"Quick status"
"Condensed update"
```

**Output format**:
```markdown
**Progress**: [1-2 sentences]
**Plans**: [1-2 sentences]
**Problems**: [1 sentence or "None"]
```

## Tips for Better Reports

### Git Journals

- **Specify time range** for focused entries: "journal the last 2 hours"
- **Add context**: "Journal this. Key insight: we chose X because Y"
- Use **descriptive commit messages** for richer output

### Devlogs

- Focus on **decisions and context**, not just what changed
- Explain **why** you made choices
- Include **learnings** others can benefit from

### Status Updates

- **Be specific** about progress: "Completed auth refactor" not "worked on auth"
- **Plans should be actionable**: what will you actually do next?
- **Don't hide problems**: surface blockers early

## Example Session

```
User: "Journal the last 4 hours"

Claude: [Runs git log --since="4 hours ago"]

Found 7 commits over 4 hours. Generating journal...

# Journal: Authentication System Refactor

## Summary
Refactored authentication to use JWT tokens instead of sessions.
Added refresh token support and updated all API endpoints.

## Work Completed

### Authentication Core
- Replaced session storage with JWT generation
- Added refresh token endpoint (7-day expiry)
- Implemented token validation middleware

### API Updates
- Updated protected routes to use new middleware
- Added token refresh logic to client
- Fixed logout to invalidate refresh tokens

## Technical Decisions
- **JWT over Sessions**: Stateless auth for future microservices
- **7-day Refresh**: Balanced security with mobile UX

## Files Changed
- `src/auth/jwt.ts` - New JWT generation
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` - Token validation
- `src/api/client.ts` - Refresh interceptor

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
- [ ] Implement token blacklist
- [ ] Update API docs

*Generated from 7 commits over 4 hours*
```

## Requirements

- **Git Journal**: Must be in a git repository with commits
- **Other types**: No special requirements

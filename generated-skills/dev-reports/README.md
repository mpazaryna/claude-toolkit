# dev-reports

> Document and communicate development work. From git commits to polished reports.

## Quick Start

```
"Journal this"
"Journal the last 4 hours"
"Write a devlog"
"22A status update"
```

## Report Types

| Type | Purpose | Trigger |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Git Journal** | Summarize work from commits | "journal this", "journal today" |
| **Devlog** | Narrative work documentation | "devlog", "write a devlog" |
| **Status (22A)** | Full Progress/Plans/Problems | "22A", "PPP update" |
| **Status (22B)** | Condensed status | "22B", "quick status" |

## How It Works

1. Tell Claude what kind of report you need
2. Skill routes to the appropriate template
3. For git journals: reads commit history automatically
4. Generates formatted report ready to save

## Examples

**Git Journal** — After a coding session:
```
"Journal this refactor"
→ Reads recent commits
→ Generates structured summary with decisions, files changed, next steps
```

**Devlog** — Explaining work to teammates:
```
"Write a devlog about the auth changes"
→ Narrative format with context, decisions, learnings
```

**Status Update** — For standups or reports:
```
"22A"
→ Progress/Plans/Problems format
→ What I did, what I'll do, what's blocking me
```

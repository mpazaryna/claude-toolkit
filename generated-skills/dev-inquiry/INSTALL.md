# Installing dev-inquiry

## Option 1: Copy to Project (Recommended)

Copy the entire `dev-inquiry` folder to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
cp -r dev-inquiry /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
```

The skill will be available in that project.

## Option 2: Global Installation

Copy to your global Claude skills directory:

```bash
cp -r dev-inquiry ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill will be available in all projects.

## Option 3: Symlink (Development)

For development, symlink to keep skills in sync:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/dev-inquiry ~/.claude/skills/dev-inquiry
```

## Verification

After installation, the skill should appear when Claude Code starts. Test with:

```
"Let's explore async/await"
```

Claude should engage investigation mode.

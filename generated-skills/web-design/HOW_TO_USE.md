# How to Use web-design

## Basic Usage

Describe what you're building and I'll provide implementation patterns:

```
"I need to set up CSS for a new project"
"Build me a button component with variants"
"Create a hero section with gradient background"
"Make this layout responsive"
```

## Modes

### 1. CSS System Setup
For project architecture and theming:

```
"Set up CSS custom properties for my project"
"How should I organize my CSS files?"
"Add dark mode support to my site"
```

### 2. Component Building
For UI components with semantic HTML:

```
"Build me a card component"
"Create a modal dialog"
"I need form input styles"
"Make a navigation bar"
```

### 3. Background & Depth
For visual interest and atmosphere:

```
"Add a gradient background to this hero"
"Create a subtle pattern overlay"
"Make this section feel more layered"
```

### 4. Responsive Design
For mobile-first, flexible layouts:

```
"Make this grid responsive"
"Set up fluid typography"
"Convert this to mobile-first CSS"
```

## Example Workflow

**Starting a new project:**

1. CSS System: "Set up CSS variables and reset"
2. Components: "Build button, card, and input components"
3. Layout: "Create responsive grid system"
4. Polish: "Add backgrounds and depth"

**Solving a specific problem:**

```
"This card doesn't have enough visual weight"
→ Gets shadow, border, and hover state suggestions
→ Includes accessibility considerations
```

## Tips

- **Provide context** - "SaaS dashboard" vs "marketing site" changes recommendations
- **Mention existing tech** - "I'm using Tailwind" affects the approach
- **Ask for variants** - "Give me primary, secondary, and ghost button styles"
- **Request responsive** - Most patterns include mobile-first by default

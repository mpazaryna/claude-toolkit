    "elevator_pitch": "A Python CLI tool that transforms scattered GitHub issues across multiple repositories into actionable intelligence through automated snapshots, AI-powered analysis, and real-time dashboards. Built for engineering managers and solo developers who need to track work across multiple projects without manual aggregation.",

    "context_and_problem": "Managing multiple GitHub repositories creates visibility gaps - issues are scattered, trends are hidden, and status reporting requires manual aggregation...",

    "solution_and_approach": "Built a two-phase system: (1) Regular timestamped snapshots of GitHub issues stored as structured datasets, and (2) Agentic workflows that process snapshots to generate insights...",

## Basic Usage

Describe what you're building:

```
"Build me a card component"

```

## Modes

### 1. View Composition
For building and structuring views:

```
"Build a profile card component"
"What's the right modifier order?"
"Create a custom view modifier"
```

### 2. State Management
For data flow and property wrappers:

```
"When do I use @StateObject vs @ObservedObject?"
"Set up MVVM for this view"
"How do I share state across views?"
```

### 3. Layout

```
"Create a responsive grid"

"Build an adaptive layout for iPad"
```

### 4. Animation

## Tips

- **Mention iOS version** - Some APIs are iOS 16+ or iOS 17+
- **Describe the context** - "For a settings screen" helps narrow recommendations
- **Ask about trade-offs** - "@State vs @StateObject" gets explanation of when to use each

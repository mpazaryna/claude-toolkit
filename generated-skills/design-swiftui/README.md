## Quick Example

```
"Build me a card component in SwiftUI"
→ Routes to views.md
→ Provides view structure with proper modifier ordering
→ Includes preview patterns

"How should I manage state for a form?"
→ Routes to state.md
→ Explains @State vs @StateObject
→ Shows MVVM pattern
```

SwiftUI rewards declarative thinking. These patterns help you work with the framework rather than against it.

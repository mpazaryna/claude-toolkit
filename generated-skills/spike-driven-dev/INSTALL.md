# Installation Guide: Spike-Driven Development Skill

## Prerequisites

- Access to Claude Code or Claude with Skills support
- This skill works with any programming language/framework
- No external dependencies required

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Claude Code (Recommended)

If you're using Claude Code, the skill may already be available. To verify:

```bash
# Check if skill is installed
ls ~/.claude/skills/ | grep spike-driven-dev
```

If not installed:

```bash
# Copy skill to global Claude skills directory
cp -r generated-skills/spike-driven-dev ~/.claude/skills/

# Or install for current project only
cp -r generated-skills/spike-driven-dev .claude/skills/
```

### Method 2: Claude Web/Desktop

1. **Locate the skill files**:
   ```
   generated-skills/spike-driven-dev/
   ├── SKILL.md           # Main skill definition
   ├── README.md          # Overview
   ├── HOW_TO_USE.md      # Usage guide
   ├── INSTALL.md         # This file
   └── references/        # Supporting documentation
       ├── decision-criteria.md
       ├── spike-patterns.md
       └── examples.md
   ```

2. **Upload to Claude**:
   - Go to your Claude interface
   - Navigate to Skills settings
   - Click "Add Custom Skill" or "Upload Skill"
   - Upload the `SKILL.md` file or entire `spike-driven-dev` directory

3. **Verify installation**:
   - Ask Claude: "Do you have the spike-driven-dev skill?"
   - Claude should confirm and describe the skill's purpose

### Method 3: Manual Integration

If your Claude environment doesn't support automatic skill loading:

1. **Reference the skill manually** in your conversations:
   ```
   "Using spike-driven development methodology, help me create a spike ticket for..."
   ```

2. **Attach reference files** as context when needed:
   - Attach `SKILL.md` for core methodology
   - Attach specific reference files for deeper guidance

## Verification

Test the installation:

```
User: "I need to validate a new SwiftData model approach"

Claude: "This is a good case for spike-driven development. Let's create a spike ticket to validate..."
```

If Claude responds with spike methodology, installation is successful!

## Configuration

### Customize for Your Workflow

You can customize the skill by editing `SKILL.md`:

1. **Adjust time-boxes** - Default is 4-8 hours, adjust as needed
2. **Add project-specific patterns** - Include your team's coding standards
3. **Customize TDD flow** - Adapt testing approach to your framework

### Add Project Examples

Enhance the skill with your own examples:

1. Edit `references/examples.md`
2. Add your successful spike stories
3. Include project-specific patterns

## Updating

To update the skill:

```bash
# Pull latest version
git pull origin main

# Re-copy to skills directory
cp -r generated-skills/spike-driven-dev ~/.claude/skills/

# Or for project-specific installation
cp -r generated-skills/spike-driven-dev .claude/skills/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Recognized

**Problem**: Claude doesn't recognize the skill

**Solutions**:
1. Verify file location: `~/.claude/skills/spike-driven-dev/SKILL.md` exists
2. Check YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md` is valid
3. Restart Claude Code if using CLI
4. Try manual reference: "Using the spike-driven-dev methodology..."

### Missing Reference Files

**Problem**: Claude can't access reference files

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all files in `references/` directory are present
2. Check file permissions are readable
3. Upload reference files individually if needed

### Skill Not Auto-Triggering

**Problem**: Claude doesn't automatically use the skill

**Solutions**:
1. Be explicit: "Let's use spike-driven development for this"
2. Check skill description matches your use case
3. Verify `description` field in `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter

## Uninstallation

To remove the skill:

```bash
# Global installation
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/spike-driven-dev

# Project-specific installation
rm -rf .claude/skills/spike-driven-dev
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Review `HOW_TO_USE.md` for usage guidance
- Check `references/` directory for detailed documentation
- Refer to Claude Code documentation for skill system details

## File Structure Reference

```
spike-driven-dev/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill definition (required)
├── README.md                   # Quick overview
├── HOW_TO_USE.md              # Detailed usage guide

    ├── spike-patterns.md      # TDD patterns and characteristics
    └── examples.md            # Real-world examples
```

All files should remain together for full functionality.

# Frontend Design Excellence Skill

> Create distinctive, well-designed frontends instead of generic "AI slop" interfaces

## Quick Start

```
"Build a landing page for a developer tool"
"Create a hero section with strong visual design"
"Design a feature grid that doesn't look generic"
```

## Overview

The Frontend Design Excellence skill helps Claude create visually distinctive, contextually appropriate frontends by providing concrete design guidance across typography, color, motion, and backgrounds.

## The Problem

Language models tend to generate generic, predictable interfaces because safe design choices dominate training data. The result: endless Inter fonts, timid color palettes, and flat designs.

## The Solution

This skill provides targeted guidance across four design dimensions:

1. **Typography**: Distinctive fonts (IBM Plex, JetBrains Mono, Playfair Display) instead of generic choices
2. **Color & Theme**: Cohesive aesthetics with CSS variables, dominant colors with sharp accents
3. **Motion**: CSS-only animations and staggered reveals for high-impact moments
4. **Backgrounds**: Layered gradients, geometric patterns, and atmospheric depth

## What This Skill Does

When invoked, Claude will:
- Choose contextually appropriate, distinctive fonts
- Build cohesive color systems with CSS variables
- Create layered, atmospheric backgrounds
- Implement purposeful CSS-only animations
- Follow accessibility and responsive design best practices
- Avoid generic "AI slop" design patterns

## Core Principles

- **Distinctive over Generic**: Avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial
- **Intentional Color**: Dominant + sharp accent, not timid pastels
- **Purposeful Motion**: High-impact moments only, CSS-only
- **Atmospheric Depth**: Layered backgrounds, not flat solids
- **Context-Aware**: Design for the specific use case

## Output Quality

Frontend code will include:
- Semantic, accessible HTML
- CSS variables for theming
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Smooth CSS animations
- Dark mode considerations
- Strong visual hierarchy

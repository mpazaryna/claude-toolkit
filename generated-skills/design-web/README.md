## Quick Example

```
"Set up CSS variables for my project"
→ Routes to css-system.md
→ Provides complete token system (colors, spacing, typography)
→ Includes dark mode setup

"Build me a card component"
→ Routes to components.md
→ Provides semantic HTML + BEM-style CSS
→ Includes hover states and accessibility
```

## Philosophy

Implementation should be systematic, not ad-hoc. CSS custom properties, consistent naming, and reusable patterns create maintainable codebases.

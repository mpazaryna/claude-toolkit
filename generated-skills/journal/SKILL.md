# Journal

This skill helps write various forms of work journals using consistent formats.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for:
- GitHub journal entries (from git commits)
- Devlogs (narrative work logs)
- Status updates (22A full, 22B condensed)
- Progress reports
- Project updates

## How to Use This Skill

To write any journal entry:

1. **Identify the journal type** from the request
2. **Load the appropriate template** from the `examples/` directory:
   - `examples/github-journal.md` - For git-based journal entries ("journal this", "journal today's work")
   - `examples/devlog.md` - For narrative devlogs
   - `examples/form-22a.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems updates (full)
   - `examples/form-22b.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems updates (condensed)
3. **Follow the specific instructions** in that file for formatting, tone, and content gathering

If the journal type doesn't match any existing template, ask for clarification or adapt the closest template.

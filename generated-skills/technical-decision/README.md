# Technical Decision Analysis Skill

> Make evidence-based technical decisions with structured analysis, comparison matrices, and ADR generation

## Quick Start

```
"Should I use SwiftData or CoreData for persistence?"
"Evaluate REST vs GraphQL for our API"
"Compare authentication approaches: JWT vs sessions"
```

## Overview

The Technical Decision Analysis skill helps you make informed technology choices through systematic research, scoring, and structured recommendations. It generates Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document your choices.

## What This Skill Does

When invoked, this skill will:
1. Understand your decision context and constraints
2. Define evaluation criteria based on decision type
3. Research each option thoroughly (using WebFetch/WebSearch)
4. Create weighted comparison matrix with scores
5. Provide clear recommendation with rationale
6. Generate ADR draft ready to save
7. Include implementation notes and validation steps

## Decision Types Supported

- **Technology Selection**: Databases, frameworks, libraries, tools
- **Architecture Decisions**: API design, sync strategies, data models
- **Implementation Approaches**: Feature implementation, refactoring strategies

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence-Based**: All recommendations backed by research and data
2. **Context-Aware**: Considers your specific project constraints
3. **Transparent Tradeoffs**: Explicitly states what you're accepting
4. **Reversibility-Aware**: Notes difficulty of changing decision later
5. **Actionable**: Provides clear next steps and validation criteria

## Output Includes

- **Options Analysis**: Pros, cons, tradeoffs, risks for each option
- **Comparison Matrix**: Weighted scoring across evaluation criteria
- **Recommendation**: Clear choice with detailed rationale
- **ADR Draft**: Architecture Decision Record in standard format
- **Implementation Notes**: Practical guidance for execution
- **References**: Sources and further reading

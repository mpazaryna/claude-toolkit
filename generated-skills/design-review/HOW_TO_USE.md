# How to Use design-review

## Basic Usage

Describe what you need reviewed:

```
"Check my app for App Store submission"
"Run an accessibility audit"
"Review this design for consistency"
```

## Modes

### 1. App Store Submission
For iOS/macOS App Store preparation:

```
"Is my app ready for App Store submission?"
"What are common rejection reasons?"
"Check my Info.plist permissions"
```

### 2. Accessibility Audit
For WCAG compliance and inclusive design:

```
"Audit this page for accessibility"
"Test with VoiceOver"
"Check color contrast"
```

### 3. Design Quality
For visual consistency and polish:

```
"Review this design for consistency"
"Check all the states I need"
"Audit the component library"
```

## Example Workflow

**Pre-submission review:**

1. "Run the App Store submission checklist"
2. "Check accessibility compliance"
3. "Review design consistency"
4. Fix issues found
5. Re-run checklists

## Tips

- **Run early** - Don't wait until the day before submission
- **Test on devices** - Simulator isn't enough
- **Fresh eyes** - Step away before final review
- **Checklist discipline** - Go through every item, don't skip

# Installation Guide: Commit Helper Skill

## Quick Install

### For Claude Code

```bash
# Global installation (available in all projects)
cp -r generated-skills/commit-helper ~/.claude/skills/

# Project-specific installation
cp -r generated-skills/commit-helper .claude/skills/
```

### For Claude Web/Desktop

1. Navigate to Skills settings
2. Click "Add Custom Skill"
3. Upload `commit-helper/SKILL.md`

## Verification

Test the installation:

```bash
# Make and stage a change
echo "test" >> README.md
git add README.md
```

Then ask Claude:
```
User: "Generate a commit message"

Claude: "I'll analyze your staged changes...

Suggested commit message:
Update README documentation
..."
```

## Prerequisites

- Git repository
- Claude Code or Claude with Skills support
- Git command access

## File Structure

```
commit-helper/
├── SKILL.md         # Main skill definition
├── README.md        # Overview
├── HOW_TO_USE.md   # Usage guide
└── INSTALL.md      # This file
```

## Integration with Git

### Optional: Create Git Alias

Add to your `.gitconfig`:

```ini
[alias]
    cm = !git diff --staged && echo "\nAsk Claude: Generate a commit message"
```

Usage:
```bash
git add .
git cm  # Shows diff, reminds you to ask Claude
```

### Optional: Git Hook Integration

Create `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Remind to use Claude for commit messages
echo "# Tip: Ask Claude to generate a commit message!" > "$1.tmp"
cat "$1" >> "$1.tmp"
mv "$1.tmp" "$1"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not recognized?**
- Verify `SKILL.md` exists in skills directory
- Check YAML frontmatter is valid
- Try explicit: "Use commit-helper skill to generate a message"

**Can't run git commands?**
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check git is installed: `git --version`
- Verify Claude has permission to run bash commands

**Messages not helpful?**
- Ensure changes are staged: `git add <files>`
- Review diff first: `git diff --staged`
- Provide context: "This is a bug fix for..."

## Uninstall

```bash
# Global
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/commit-helper

# Project-specific
rm -rf .claude/skills/commit-helper
```

## Customization

Edit `SKILL.md` to customize for your project:

1. **Add project conventions**
   ```markdown
   ## Project Commit Conventions
   - Use ticket numbers: "ABC-123: message"
   - Always include component prefix: "[api]", "[ui]"
   ```

2. **Add examples**
   ```markdown
   ## Example Commits
   - "feat(auth): add 2FA support"
   - "fix(db): resolve connection pool leak"
   ```

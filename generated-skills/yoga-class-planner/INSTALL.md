## Customization

### Adjust Class Duration

Default is 60 minutes, but you can request other durations:

```
"Create a 45-minute yoga class"
"Generate a 75-minute sequence"
```

### Focus Areas

Specify focus areas for targeted classes:

```
"Create a class focusing on core strength"
"Plan a sequence emphasizing hip openers"
"Generate a class for lower back relief"
```

### Difficulty Level

Default is beginner-friendly, but you can adjust:

```
"Create an intermediate-level class"
"Plan a gentle/restorative sequence"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Recognized

**Solutions:**
1. Verify installation: `ls ~/.claude/skills/yoga-class-planner/SKILL.md`
2. Check YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md is valid
3. Try explicit request: "Use yoga-class-planner skill to create a class"
4. Restart Claude Code if using CLI

### Output Not Detailed Enough

**Solutions:**
1. Request specific details: "Include detailed alignment cues"
2. Ask for modifications: "Add beginner modifications for each pose"
3. Specify teaching cues: "Include breath cues for each pose"

### Class Too Advanced

The skill defaults to beginner-friendly. If output seems too advanced:
1. Explicitly request: "Create a gentle beginner class"
2. Specify: "Focus on basic foundational poses"
3. Ask for: "Include more modifications and easier variations"

## Customizing Generated Classes

After Claude generates a class, you can refine it:

### Adjust Difficulty
```
This looks good, but can you make the standing section more gentle?
Some students are very new.
```

### Swap Poses
```
Can you replace Triangle Pose with something easier?
And add one more hip opener in the cool-down section.
```

### Change Timing
```
Can you extend the savasana to 8 minutes and reduce the peak pose section to
10 minutes?
```

### Add More Detail
```
Can you add more detailed alignment cues for Warrior II?
My students often struggle with this pose.
```

Students have wrist issues - please minimize weight-bearing on hands
```

### Specify Available Props
```
We have blocks, straps, and blankets available
```

### Request Specific Energy Levels
- "Gentle and restorative"
- "Moderate energy, balanced"
- "Energizing and strengthening"

### Ask for Teaching Support
```
Can you add extra teaching cues for poses that are challenging for beginners?
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Weekly Class Planning
```
@yoga-class-planner

Create 3 different 60-minute beginner classes for this week:
1. Monday: Gentle flexibility focus
2. Wednesday: Moderate strength and balance
3. Friday: Relaxing stress-relief class
```

### Workflow 2: Substitute Teaching
```
@yoga-class-planner

I'm subbing a beginner class tonight. Need a well-rounded 60-minute sequence.
Students are mixed levels but all fairly new. Props available: blocks and straps.
```

### Workflow 3: Private Client
```
@yoga-class-planner

Private client, true beginner, 60 minutes. They have tight hamstrings and
shoulders from desk work. Very gentle approach needed.
```

### Workflow 4: Workshop Prep
```
@yoga-class-planner

I'm teaching a "Intro to Yoga" workshop. Need a foundational 60-minute class
that introduces basic poses and yoga breathing. Very detailed instructions please.
```

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

To set clear expectations:

- Does NOT create themed classes (chakras, moon cycles, seasons, etc.)
- Does NOT suggest music playlists or sound recommendations
- Does NOT include yoga philosophy or spiritual teachings
- Does NOT provide advanced or intermediate pose sequences
- Does NOT create classes shorter or longer than 60 minutes (though timing is flexible within sections)

**Focus**: Pure, practical, beginner-friendly physical yoga sequences

## Troubleshooting

### "The class feels too advanced"
```
Can you simplify this? Make it appropriate for absolute beginners who have
never done yoga before.
```

### "I need more time in certain sections"
```
Can you add 5 more minutes to the cool-down and reduce the standing section
by 5 minutes?
```

### "The poses are too complex"
```
Can you replace the more challenging poses with foundational alternatives?
```

### "I need more teaching detail"
```
Can you expand the alignment cues for [specific pose]? My students need
more guidance.
```

## Integration with Your Teaching

### Print and Teach
- Generate the class plan
- Print or save to your device
- Teach directly from the sequence
- Make notes for future adjustments

### Create Templates
- Generate several classes
- Save successful sequences
- Mix and match sections
- Build your own library

### Student Handouts
- Share sequence with students after class
- Provide pose instructions for home practice
- Create class summaries

### Continuing Education
- Study pose variations
- Learn new teaching cues
- Expand your sequencing knowledge

## Advanced Usage

### Create Variations
```
@yoga-class-planner

Take this class you just created and make 2 variations:
1. Gentler version for very new students
2. Slightly more challenging for progressing beginners
```

### Focus on Specific Body Areas
```
@yoga-class-planner

Create a 60-minute class that specifically targets:
- Hip flexors
- Hamstrings
- Lower back tension

All beginner-friendly with lots of props.
```

### Seasonal Adjustments
```
@yoga-class-planner

It's winter and students are stiff and tired. Create a gentle 60-minute class
that warms up the body slowly and includes lots of hip and shoulder work.
```
